This is my first project done at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive in Feb 2019. 

The aim of the game is to get four of the same colors in a row or column or diagonal. The first player to do so wins the game. This game should be played with another human player. Hint: The winning strategy is to always begin in the centre. The first player to play has a higher chance of winning.

This game was created using html canvas feature.
